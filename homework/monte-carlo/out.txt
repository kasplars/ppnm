Part A

Volume of sphere of radius 0.5 using pseudo-Monte Carlo:
Real volume = 0.52359878, calculated volume = 0.523617, calculated error = 0.00049944193. Number of points = 1000000


Integral given in homework calculated using pseudo-Monte Carlo:
Calculated volume = 1.3911627, calculated error = 0.0035757318. Number of points = 10000000


Part B

Volume of sphere of radius 0.5 using quasi-random Monte Carlo:
Calculated volume = 0.5216, calculated error = 0.0034. Number of points = 5000

The scalings of the errors between the pseudo- and quasi-random Monte Carlo are seen in the figure. We see that the error drops significantly
faster with the number of points when using the quasi-random sequence than the pseudo-random one.
